# Atlas Suite
A suite to build, analyze and visualize atlases(?)

- [atlas-densities](#atlas-densities) — Create the volumetric density data files for brain regions.
- [atlas-direction-vectors](#atlas-direction-vectors) — Generation of artificial neuronal trees based on the topology of biological cells and their statistical properties.
- [atlas-placement-hints](#atlas-placement-hints) — Generation of artificial neuronal trees based on the topology of biological cells and their statistical properties.
- [atlas-splitter Workflows](#atlas-splitter) — Generation of artificial neuronal trees based on the topology of biological cells and their statistical properties.
- [atlas-alignment-meter](#atlas-alignment-meter) — Pythonic tool (CLI and library) to measure the slice-to-slice jaggedness of a volumetric dataset (NRRD file only).
- [Deep Atlas Suite](#deep-atlas-suite) — A suite of tools created by the Blue Brain Project to manipulate brain atlas images.
